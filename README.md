I created this desktop app to hone my programming skills and to build myself an app that has everything that i would want to use without 
needing to trust the discretion of websites that offer a, for instance video or image downloader, but that does not look trustworthy.

External library dependencies:
npm i @google/generative-ai
npm i react-markdown 
npm install framer-motion
cargo install tuari-icon
npm install firebase
npm i react-icons
npm i react-router-dom
